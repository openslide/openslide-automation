This repository contains infrastructure for automatically building and
testing OpenSlide.


## Buildmaster configuration

### stunnel

Buildslave connections to the master are wrapped with stunnel and
authenticated with a PKI (and also with Buildbot-level buildslave
passwords).  Use easy-rsa to set up the PKI.  On Debian, the
master-side stunnel configuration looks like this:

```
pid = /var/run/stunnel4/stunnel.pid
setuid = stunnel4
setgid = stunnel4

[openslide_buildbot]
CAfile = /etc/stunnel/buildbot-ca.crt
cert = /etc/stunnel/buildbot.crt
key = /etc/stunnel/buildbot.key
verify = 2
options = NO_SSLv2
options = NO_SSLv3
accept  = 2000
connect = 9989
```


### Buildbot

1. Create a user account to run the buildmaster.
2. Clone this repo into the account's home directory.
3. Install `libaprutil`.
4. Download a source tarball of Buildbot.
5. Use quilt to apply the patches from the
   [buildbot-patches](buildbot-patches) directory:

    ```
cd buildbot-0.8.xx
ln -s .../openslide-automation/buildbot-patches patches
quilt push -a
```
6. `pip install` the unpacked source tree into a virtualenv in the
   user account's home directory.

    }

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8010;
        # Ensure log streaming works correctly
        proxy_buffering off;
        # Allow log streaming to pause for 20 minutes before giving up
